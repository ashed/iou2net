iou2net is an open-source drop-in replacement for IOUlive, a proprietary
application written by cisco Systems, Inc.

iou2net, written in Perl, allows you to "bridge" virtual routers and
switches running on the Cisco IOS-on-UNIX (IOU) software to a physical
network.

In functionality, it is nearly identical to what IOUlive does. For more
information about IOU or IOUlive, ask your Cisco SE/AM that provided you
with your copy of IOU, or check out the Cisco IOU FAQ at:
